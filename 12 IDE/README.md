A notebook interface (also called a computational notebook) is a virtual notebook environment used for literate programming.[1] It pairs the functionality of word processing software with both the shell and kernel of that notebook's programming language. Millions of people use notebooks interfaces[2] to analyze data for science, journalism, and education.
